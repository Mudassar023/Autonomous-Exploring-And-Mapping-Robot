**Autonomous Exploring and Mapping Robot (Simulation)**

Final Year Project - Sir Syed CASE Institute of Technology, Islamabad


**Overview**

The Autonomous Exploring and Mapping Robot is a simulation-based project developed using ROS (Robot Operating System), Gazebo, and SLAM algorithms. It focuses on simulating autonomous navigation and mapping in a controlled environment.
Using LiDAR and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), the robot can explore an unknown space, avoid obstacles, and generate an accurate 2D map.


**Features**

âœ… Autonomous Navigation â€“ Path planning using RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) 

âœ… Simulated Environment â€“ Testing in Gazebo before real-world deployment 

âœ… SLAM Mapping â€“ Real-time 2D mapping using Gmapping algorithm 

âœ… Obstacle Avoidance â€“ LiDAR-based detection and path correction 

âœ… ROS Integration â€“ Uses ROS Noetic for robot control and visualization



**Simulation Environment**

The project was completely simulation-based and did not involve real hardware.
Gazebo was used to simulate the robot in a structured environment. 
Rviz visualized sensor data, mapping progress, and navigation paths. 
SLAM algorithms enabled simultaneous mapping and localization.


**Software & Tools Used**

ROS Noetic â€“ Framework for robotics applications 

Gazebo â€“ 3D simulation environment for testing robot behavior

Rviz â€“ Visualization tool for SLAM and sensor data 

Python & C++ â€“ Programming languages used for algorithms
